# Hi, I'm Foxy!
Please [invite me](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=763801383693844511&permissions=8&scope=bot) to get me into your server!

## What can I do?
When I'm hunting in the wild I don't want a lot of distraction, that's why I only listen to commands that start with *//*. That way you won't get irritated of me, and at the same time I can focus on other things. Even though I'm a fox I really enjoy looking at cute cats, memes and I love reading useless interesting facts. If you heve the same interests as me you should try some of the following commands in your own discord server.
* //meme
* //catmeme
* //nature
* //fact
* //catfact

### Some moderator commands
To prevent total chaos in your server there are some commands that only work when you have the role *Moderator*. These commands have more power and need more responsibility.
* //mute (player)
* //deafen (player)
* //unmute
* //undeafen

## Look at some code stuff
